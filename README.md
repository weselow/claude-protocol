## Why

Claude Code loses context. Plans disappear after compaction. Tasks are forgotten between sessions. Changes go straight to main with no traceability.

Claude Protocol fixes this with three things:

- **Beads** — persistent task tracking. One task = one worktree = one PR. Survives restarts and compaction.
- **Hooks** — enforcement, not instructions. Edits on main are blocked. Completion without checklist is blocked. `git --no-verify` is blocked.
- **bd prime** — session start hook loads recent beads so state survives context loss.

Constraints over instructions. What's blocked can't be ignored.

## Origin

This project started as a fork of [The Claude Protocol](https://github.com/AvivK5498/The-Claude-Protocol) by Aviv Kaplan. The original author appears to have stopped development — PRs go unreviewed, and the underlying tools (beads CLI, Claude Code hooks API) have changed significantly.

v3 is a ground-up rewrite. Different architecture, different philosophy. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions-en.md) for full rationale.

## What Changed in v3

### Unreleased

- **`npx` installs every skill the plugin carries** — the installer named
  `project-discovery` and nothing else, while the plugin loads every directory
  under `templates/skills`. A second skill would have reached plugin users
  only, and `--project-only` would have left its copy in the project. Both now
  read the same list. An edited skill file is still a question, and a file of
  your own inside a skill directory is still left alone.
- **A review skill, and `code-reviewer` built on it** — `bead-review` checks a
  bead's branch, PR or commit range against the task and its acceptance
  criteria, and reports findings R1, R2… pinned to the head SHA, keeping their
  numbers on a re-review. `code-reviewer` now preloads the skill instead of
  carrying a procedure of its own: it no longer demands DEMO blocks that no
  rule asked implementers to write, no longer pins `model: haiku`, and no
  longer assumes the diff is `main...bd-<id>`. Both install through `npx` and
  the plugin alike. An agent copy you never edited is replaced on upgrade; an
  edited one is a question, as before.

### v3.9.2 (2026-09-07)

- **A new version is announced within a day, not a week** — the update check
  caches its answer so a session start never waits on the network, and the
  window was a week. Two releases went out on one afternoon and every cache
  written that morning kept answering with the version before them. One
  request a day per machine costs nothing and the news arrives while it is
  news.

### v3.9.1 (2026-09-07)

- **An entry already anchored with a slash is not added again** — `.gitignore`
  entries were compared as written, so a project spelling them `/.worktrees/`
  and `/.claude/.upgrades/` got a second, unanchored copy of each appended on
  every install. git reads both spellings as the same path at the repository
  root.

### v3.9.0 (2026-09-07)

- **One source supplies the hooks, whichever order you install in** — the
  plugin and `npx claude-protocol init` wire the same three hooks, and Claude
  Code merges hooks from every source, so a project carrying both ran each one
  twice. Now the copy installed in a project stands down while the plugin is
  active, `npx claude-protocol init` installs only the project half when the
  plugin is already there, and the session-start hook says the leftovers exist
  and names the command that removes them. All three read Claude Code's own
  plugin registry; a registry that is missing, unreadable or shaped
  unfamiliarly, or a plugin switched off in settings, installs and runs exactly
  as before.

- **The plugin loads without a duplicate-hooks error** — `plugin.json` named
  `hooks/hooks.json`, the one file Claude Code loads by itself, so every
  startup reported `Duplicate hooks file detected`. The manifest field is for
  hook files *besides* the standard one. The line is gone and a test keeps it
  from coming back; the hooks themselves were never affected, because the
  automatic load is the one that won.

### v3.8.1 (2026-09-05)

- **The release build runs on the Node 24 action runtime** — `checkout`,
  `setup-node`, `setup-python` and `action-gh-release` were still declaring
  Node 20, which GitHub has deprecated. Nothing in the package changed.

### v3.8.0 (2026-09-05)

- **Install as a plugin** — the repository is now also a Claude Code
  marketplace. The plugin carries the hooks, agents and skill and updates them
  itself; `/claude-protocol:init` lays down the half a plugin cannot carry
  (beads, rules, `CLAUDE.md`) and unwires an earlier `npx` install so no hook
  fires twice. `npx claude-protocol init` is unchanged.
- **The enforcement hooks stand down in a project without `.beads/`** — they
  had nothing to check there, and a plugin at user scope is loaded everywhere.
- **`bd` is asked about, not installed behind your back** — the installer
  prints the command for your machine and waits; `--install-beads` answers yes
  in advance. It then checks the system can actually find `bd`, warns when it
  is older than 1.1.0, and no longer hand-makes an empty `.beads/` when
  `bd init` fails.
- **You are told when a newer claude-protocol is out** — once a week, at
  session start, from a process with a time limit, silent on any failure.
- **`CLAUDE.md` arrives in your language** — `--lang ru` used to install
  Russian rules and English orchestrator instructions, because no Russian
  template existed. There is one now, with English as the fallback wherever a
  translation is missing.
- **Small findings get fixed, not filed** — `beads-workflow.md` used to make a
  bead of everything stumbled on; now the default is to fix it in the same
  branch, with a bead only for what will not fit inside the current work.
- **The hooks stopped losing their arguments on Windows** — commands went
  through `cmd.exe`, which split an argument on spaces, ate quotes and would
  have run whatever followed a `&&`. For some people the hooks did not work at
  all.
- **`--force` no longer destroys a rule you edited** — the flag skipped the one
  place that kept your version. What it overwrites now goes to
  `.claude/.upgrades/<path>.mine` first.
- **A path of the wrong kind stops one file, not the whole install** — a
  directory where our file belongs, or a file where our directory belongs, used
  to end the upgrade mid-way with a stack trace, leaving `settings.json`,
  `CLAUDE.md` and the manifest unwritten.

### v3.7.0 (2026-09-03)

- **The upgrade asks instead of leaving homework** — a file you edited that we
  also changed becomes a question, one at a time, with a diff on request; `K`
  and `T` answer for everything remaining. Whichever version loses is kept
  under `.claude/.upgrades/`.
- **Questions only where someone can answer** — stdin and stdout must both be a
  terminal. Batch runs, CI and an agent driving the CLI keep the silent
  behaviour rather than hanging on input that will never come. `--keep-mine`
  is the counterpart to `--force`.
- **`--dry-run` wrote files** — the flag reached only the cleanup pass, so the
  preview the README tells you to run first modified the project it was
  previewing.

### v3.6.0 (2026-09-03)

- **Hook commands stopped using relative paths** — a hook process inherits the
  working directory of the last Bash call, so `node .claude/hooks/x.cjs` went
  silently missing as soon as work moved into a subdirectory or a worktree.
  Commands now resolve the project root inside Node, and an upgrade rewrites
  stale ones instead of appending duplicates.
- **Five hooks down to three** — `enforce-branch-before-edit` and
  `nudge-claude-md-update` removed, and upgrades clean them out of existing
  installs. `bash-guard` now checks every command in a chain: `cd sub && git
  commit --no-verify` used to slip through.
- **New rule `pre-code-workflow.md`** in both languages, plus
  `repository-scope.md`. Raw `git worktree add` is blocked — it creates a
  shadow `.beads/`.

### v3.5.0 (2026-05-27)

- **New rule `communication-style.md`** — plain language over jargon, in both
  language sets.

### v3.4.0 (2026-05-15)

- **New rule `debugging-standard.md`** — the same error surviving a deliberate
  fix is the trigger to stop repeating and change approach.

### v3.3.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Upgrade mechanism** — new `npx claude-protocol upgrade` command with
  `--dry-run` and `--all <parent>` for batch runs across workspaces. Every
  removal is backed up to `.claude/.upgrades/<timestamp>/`.
- **Memory system removed** — `knowledge.jsonl`, `memory-capture.cjs`, and
  `recall.cjs` are gone. bd's native `bd remember` / `bd memories` takes
  over. Legacy files are cleaned up automatically during upgrade.
- **bd 1.0.2 compatibility** — bd repo moved to gastownhall; install URLs
  updated. Workflow no longer uses the obsolete `inreview` status.
- **Path traversal guard** — upgrade never writes or deletes outside the
  project directory.

Stripped everything that doesn't improve output. Added everything that does.

**Removed:**
- 5 specialized agents (Scout, Detective, Architect, Scribe, Discovery) — duplicated built-in Claude Code capabilities
- Per-tech supervisor generation — 500+ lines of context per stack, Claude already knows these technologies
- Agent personas ("Rex the reviewer") — based on outdated prompting patterns, just fills context
- MCP Provider Delegator, Kanban UI, Web Interface Guidelines — unnecessary infrastructure
- 19 bash hooks — replaced with 3 cross-platform Node.js hooks

**Added:**
- Checklist verification — hook blocks completion if requirements from description aren't checked off
- Session-start dashboard — shows what the task tracker cannot: dirty main checkout, merged PRs awaiting cleanup, worktrees left behind
- Mandatory size check — automatic decision: single bead or epic with children
- Plan-to-beads requirement — all planned tasks must be created as beads before implementation starts
- LEARNED quality enforcement — specific format: problem → solution → context
- Safe install and upgrade — SHA-256 manifest tracks user modifications, `--force` for clean reinstall
- bd command reference in rules — prevents Claude from inventing nonexistent commands

**Changed:**
- Rules are trigger-based ("when you create an API endpoint → add logging") instead of reference documents
- Knowledge base search is mandatory before every investigation
- Dev rules (implementation, logging, TDD) included by default

## How It Works

### What gets installed

```
.claude/
  agents/
    code-reviewer.md        # Reviews a bead, following bead-review
    merge-supervisor.md     # Conflict resolution protocol
  hooks/                    # 3 Node.js enforcement hooks, shared utils,
                            # and the update checker they spawn
  rules/
    beads-workflow.md       # Task lifecycle, bd command reference
    pre-code-workflow.md    # Three gates before any edit
    implementation-standard.md
    communication-style.md
    debugging-standard.md
    logging-standard.md
    tdd-workflow.md
    resilience-standard.md
  skills/
    project-discovery/      # Extracts project conventions
    bead-review/            # Review procedure and the request form
  settings.json             # Hook configuration
  .manifest.json            # File hashes for safe upgrades
CLAUDE.md                   # Orchestrator instructions
.beads/                     # Task database + knowledge base
```

That is the `npx` install. As a plugin, only `rules/`, `.manifest.json`,
`CLAUDE.md` and `.beads/` land in the project — the hooks, the agents and the
skills stay in the plugin, which is what lets them update on their own.

### Safe for existing projects — and for upgrades

First install and re-install use the same command: `npx claude-protocol init`.

- **Hooks** — always updated to the latest version (enforcement code). Only files we ship are replaced; a hook of your own is untouched.
- **Rules, agents and skills** — updated only if you haven't modified them. A file you edited becomes a question; the version you don't pick is kept under `.claude/.upgrades/`. Files of your own inside a skill directory are never touched.
- **CLAUDE.md** — only the block between `<!-- claude-protocol:begin -->` and `<!-- claude-protocol:end -->` is ours, and only that block is refreshed. Your overview, tech stack and current state are never touched.
- **settings.json** — hooks merged by event type. Your existing hooks stay.
- **.gitignore** — missing entries appended. Nothing removed.

Use `--force` to take our version of every file. Rules, agents, skills and the CLAUDE.md block are copied to `.claude/.upgrades/<path>.mine` first, and an earlier copy is never overwritten, so every version you replace is still there. Hooks are replaced outright with no copy — they are enforcement code, replaced on every run anyway.

### What happens at session start

The `session-start` hook says only what the task tracker cannot. `bd prime`
already prints the beads — in progress, ready, blocked, stale — so repeating
them here would cost a second listing and tell you nothing new.

What it does report:

- **ACTION REQUIRED** — a branch that was merged while its worktree and bead
  are still open, with the command to close both
- **WARNING** — uncommitted changes in the main checkout, because agents would
  branch off them
- **Open PRs** — yours, still awaiting review
- **An outdated `bd`** — older than the version the rules rely on, with the
  command to update it
- **A newer claude-protocol** — checked at most once a day, in a process of
  its own with a time limit, and silent on any failure

Nothing to report means nothing printed.

### Project discovery

After installation, run `/project-discovery` in Claude Code. It scans your codebase and writes `.claude/rules/project-conventions.md` with:

- Tech stack and frameworks detected
- Naming conventions and patterns
- Testing setup and commands
- Anti-patterns specific to your project

This file is auto-loaded into every agent context. No per-tech supervisor generation needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- git
- [beads CLI](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads#-installation) (`bd`) 1.1.0
  or newer

### Install

```bash
npx claude-protocol init
```

Restart Claude Code. Run `/project-discovery`.

**When `bd` is missing**, the installer prints the command for your machine and
asks before running it — a global program is your decision. A run nobody can
answer (CI, a batch upgrade, an agent driving the CLI) installs nothing and
prints the command instead; `--install-beads` says yes ahead of time. An
installed `bd` the system still cannot find stops the run: the install
directory is not on this shell's PATH, so open a new terminal and try again.

**When `bd` is older than 1.1.0**, the installer warns and keeps going, and the
session-start hook repeats the warning once per session. Nothing is updated for
you — the rules need `bd memories`, `bd remember`, `bd worktree` and `bd prime`,
and an old `bd` fails those one at a time with no explanation.

### Install as a plugin

The same thing, installed through Claude Code's own plugin system. The plugin
carries the hooks, the agents and the skills (project-discovery and
bead-review), and updates them for you. What a plugin cannot carry is the half
that has to live in the project — the beads database, `.claude/rules/*.md` and
the block in `CLAUDE.md` — so one command lays that half down.

```
/plugin marketplace add weselow/claude-protocol
/plugin install claude-protocol@claude-protocol
/claude-protocol:init
```

Choose the scope when installing: **user** for every project you open,
**project** to share it with everyone on the repository through
`.claude/settings.json`, **local** for this repository and only you. The hooks
stand down in any project that has no `.beads/`, so user scope does not police
your unrelated repositories.

**Auto-update is off by default** for a third-party marketplace — the plugin
stays at the version you installed until you turn it on in `/plugin` →
**Marketplaces** → **claude-protocol** → **Enable auto-update**. Whether it is
on or off, the session-start hook tells you within a day of a newer version
being out.

**Already installed with `npx`?** Nothing runs twice. Hooks merge from every
source, so the copies in `.claude/hooks/` would fire alongside the plugin's —
instead they stand down while the plugin is the active one, and the
session-start hook says the leftovers are there. `/claude-protocol:init`
removes them: it takes out the copies it installed, unwires them from
`settings.json`, and lists what it took; copies of everything removed go to
`.claude/.upgrades/`. Files you added yourself are left alone. Running `npx
claude-protocol init` in a project that has the plugin installs only the
project half, for the same reason — whichever order you install them in, one
source ends up supplying the hooks.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project-dir PATH` | Target directory (default: current) |
| `--project-name NAME` | Project name for CLAUDE.md (auto-inferred from package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod) |
| `--no-rules` | Skip dev rules (implementation, logging, TDD, resilience) |
| `--lang en\|ru` | Language for the dev rules and CLAUDE.md (default: en) |
| `--force` | Take our version of every file, no questions asked (yours is kept in `.claude/.upgrades/`) |
| `--keep-mine` | Keep your version of every file you edited, no questions asked |
| `--install-beads` | Install the beads CLI without asking (default: ask, and install nothing when nobody can answer) |
| `--project-only` | Install only what a plugin cannot carry — beads, rules, CLAUDE.md — and hand hooks, agents and skills over to the plugin. This is what `/claude-protocol:init` runs |

### Local development (before npm publish)

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-protocol && npm link
npx claude-protocol init  # works in any project
```

## Upgrade

Existing projects upgrade safely: only claude-protocol's own artifacts are
cleaned up, and every removal is backed up first.

When a file you edited also changed on our side, the upgrade asks — per file,
with a diff on request, and `K`/`T` to answer for all the rest at once. The
version you do not choose is kept next to the file under `.claude/.upgrades/`,
so nothing you wrote is ever lost. Where no one can answer — batch upgrades,
CI, an agent driving the CLI — your files are kept and ours are saved beside
them. `--force` and `--keep-mine` answer for every file up front.

**CLAUDE.md is different: it is yours, and only a marked block inside it is
ours.** Everything between `<!-- claude-protocol:begin -->` and
`<!-- claude-protocol:end -->` is replaced on upgrade; the project overview,
tech stack and current state around it are never read, never rewritten. A
project installed before the markers existed is asked once — with a diff —
whether to mark the block it already carries. Say no and nothing changes: the
current template lands in `.claude/.upgrades/CLAUDE.md`, exactly as before.

### Preview (recommended first)

```bash
npx claude-protocol@latest upgrade --dry-run
```

Prints the exact list of files, directories, and settings-hook entries that
would change, and writes nothing at all — every line of the preview is
prefixed `[DRY-RUN]`.

### Apply

```bash
npx claude-protocol@latest upgrade
```

Runs the init flow and then strips obsolete artifacts. Every removal is
backed up under `.claude/.upgrades/<UTC-timestamp>/` so you can roll back by
copying files out of the backup directory.

### Batch (multiple projects)

```bash
npx claude-protocol@latest upgrade --all /path/to/parent
```

Iterates every direct subdirectory of the parent that contains a `.beads/`
folder and upgrades each one. Combine with `--dry-run` to audit before
applying.

### Rollback

The backup directory `.claude/.upgrades/<timestamp>/obsolete/` mirrors the
project tree. Copy the file(s) you want back into place. Nothing is ever
hard-deleted.

## Workflow

### Every task goes through beads

```
Plan → Size check → Create beads → bd ready → Dispatch → Worktree → PR → Merge → Close
```

**Size check** runs automatically before creating beads:
- More than 3 files or multiple domains (DB + API + frontend) → epic with children
- More than 50 lines estimated → consider splitting
- Otherwise → single bead

One bead = one worktree = one PR = one reviewable diff.

### Parallel work

```bash
bd dep add TASK-2 TASK-1    # TASK-2 is blocked by TASK-1
bd close TASK-1              # TASK-2 becomes ready
bd ready                     # shows all unblocked tasks
```

Orchestrator dispatches all ready tasks in parallel via `Task()`.

### Quick fix

For changes under 10 lines on a feature branch. Hard blocked on main.

```bash
git checkout -b fix-typo     # must be off main
# edit → commit
```

### Completion verification

Subagents are blocked from finishing unless:
- `Checklist:` section present with all `[x]` items checked
- Bead status set to `inreview`
- Code committed and pushed
- Comment left on bead
- Response within verbosity limits (25 lines / 1200 chars)

### Reviewing a bead

When an implementer leaves `AWAITING REVIEW`, hand the work to the
`code-reviewer` agent, or run the skill yourself: `/bead-review` after an `npx`
install, `/claude-protocol:bead-review` with the plugin. Both follow one
procedure, the skill's `SKILL.md`: read the project's rules and the bead, pin
the base and head SHAs, read the change and the code around it, run what the
verdict depends on, then report. After an `npx` install the skill is in
`.claude/skills/bead-review/`; the plugin keeps it in its own
`templates/skills/bead-review/`.

The report names the head SHA it checked and ends in `changes needed` or `no
blocking findings`. Findings are numbered R1, R2… and keep their numbers on a
re-review. Defects carry a priority and are kept apart from questions and
optional suggestions, and each one cites `file:line` or a command with its
output. The reviewer changes no code and posts to the PR or the bead only when
asked. It never merges or closes anything: the user closes the bead after
merging.

Requests that work:

```
Review bead proj-42, PR #57.
Review proj-42 on main...bd-proj-42 at 3f2c1ab. npm test passes.
Review proj-42, commits 1a2b3c4..3f2c1ab.
Re-review proj-42 at 9e81d04. Previous report above; R1, R3 fixed, R2 disputed.
```

A range that starts with a branch name (`main...bd-proj-42`, and
`main..bd-proj-42` too) is reviewed from the point where the branches split;
otherwise everything `main` gained after the work began would look deleted by
the implementer. A range of two commit SHAs is taken as given.

A lead or an implementer asking for a review can fill in the form in the
skill's `handoff.md`. The skill is called `bead-review`,
not `code-review`, so that it does not replace Claude Code's own
`/code-review`. Apart from one short section, nothing in it is specific to
Claude Code, so an agent that reads the same SKILL.md format, such as Codex,
can follow it too.

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Enforcement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| bash-guard | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `--no-verify` and raw `git worktree add`. Requires description on `bd create`. Validates epic close (all children done, PR merged). Every command in a chain is checked, not just the first. |
| validate-completion | SubagentStop | Checks worktree, push, status, checklist, comment, verbosity. |
| session-start | SessionStart | Dirty main checkout, worktrees of merged branches, open PRs, a `bd` older than the rules need, a newer claude-protocol. Task listing is left to `bd prime`. |
| update-check | — | Not a hook: the helper `session-start` spawns so the version check gets a time limit of its own. Answer cached for a day; silent on any failure. |
| hook-utils | — | Shared utilities: project-dir resolution, command splitting, deny/ask/block, execCommand. |

**In a project without `.beads/`, the enforcement hooks stand down.** They act
on a bead lifecycle that is not there, and refusing `--no-verify` in a
repository that never asked for any of this is not their call. It matters for a
plugin installed at user scope, which is loaded for every project you open.

Installed from npm, hook commands resolve `.claude/hooks/` from
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` rather than a relative path: a hook process inherits the
working directory of the last Bash call, so a relative path stops resolving as
soon as work moves into a subdirectory — and Claude Code reports that as
non-blocking, leaving the hook silently absent. Installed as a plugin, Claude
Code resolves them itself from `hooks/hooks.json` through
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and none of that wiring is written into your project.

## Dev Rules

Included by default. Skip with `--no-rules`. Russian version: `npx claude-protocol init --lang ru`.

| Rule | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| pre-code-workflow | Trigger-based: three gates before touching code — entry points and an understanding table, reuse-or-write with `file:line` risks, a 7–15 item plan with an explicit out-of-scope section. Hands off to beads-workflow once the plan is accepted. |
| implementation-standard | Applies while writing code. Metrics (function < 30 lines, class < 200, nesting < 4). Rule of 3 alternatives. Self-review with `/simplify` trigger. |
| communication-style | Trigger-based: fires before every reply. Plain words over jargon, explain a term at first use, numbers instead of adjectives. |
| debugging-standard | Trigger-based: "the same error survived a deliberate fix" → stop repeating, search memory, read the source, then three alternatives. |

## FAQ

**Q: `bd init` hangs during installation.**
A: Dolt server is not running. Bootstrap creates `.beads/` manually after 15s timeout. Run `bd init` later when Dolt is available, or use SQLite backend.

**Q: Hooks don't work after installation.**
A: Restart Claude Code. Hooks load from `settings.json` at startup.

**Q: Claude invents commands like `bd export`.**
A: `beads-workflow.md` includes a full command reference table. If Claude still invents commands, it didn't read the rules — check that `.claude/rules/` exists.

**Q: What happens if I run `init` again after updating claude-protocol?**
A: Rules, agents and skills you edited become a question, one file at a time, with a diff on request; the version you do not pick is kept under `.claude/.upgrades/`. Hooks are always updated. In CLAUDE.md only our marked block is refreshed — the rest of the file stays yours. `--force` and `--keep-mine` answer for everything up front.

**Q: Can I use this without Dolt?**
A: Yes. Beads works with SQLite by default. Dolt adds version history and branching for the task database.
