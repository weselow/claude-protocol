Bootstrap script for beads-based orchestration.

Creates:
- .beads/ directory with beads CLI
- .claude/agents/ with code-reviewer and merge-supervisor
- .claude/hooks/ with enforcement hooks (Node.js)
- .claude/rules/ with beads-workflow and optional dev rules
- .claude/skills/ with every skill in templates/skills
- .claude/settings.json with hook configuration
- .claude/.manifest.json with file hashes for safe upgrades
- .claude/.upgrades/ with new versions of user-modified files
- CLAUDE.md with orchestrator instructions

Usage:
    python bootstrap.py [--project-name NAME] [--project-dir DIR] [--with-rules] [--force]

# HOOK COMMAND PATHS
# ============================================================================
# A hook process does NOT run in the project root — it inherits the working
# directory of the last Bash tool call. A relative command path
# (`node .claude/hooks/bash-guard.cjs`) therefore resolves against a
# subdirectory or a worktree, Node exits with "Cannot find module", and Claude
# Code treats it as non-blocking: the tool call proceeds with that hook
# silently absent. templates/settings.json holds the fix — a `node -e` wrapper
# that resolves the project root from CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, falling back to
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, then cwd.
#
# The wrapper deliberately avoids `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` inside the command:
# variable expansion is the shell's job, and hook commands run under
# PowerShell when Git Bash is absent, where `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is an
# undefined variable that collapses to an empty string (measured — it fails
# even from the project root).
